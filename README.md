# pdfcli

Experimentation to learn about PDF structure and development. Very rough for now as I figure out what can be done and how I might go about doing it. Absolutely not a program that should be used for working with real PDF documents.

**Note** Since I am experimenting I have implemented a bunch of prototype stuff in the utility files. I have also written a bunch of tests for those things, but those tests in the parser file and a separate pdf object test file. For a real project this would be absolute chaos. If you happen to be here looking for my code it might not be where you expect to find it.
